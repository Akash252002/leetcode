        "Local outlier detection is more appropriate than global outlier detection in situations where the data is not normally distributed and there are clusters of outliers. For example, in the case of credit card fraud detection, there may be a small number of fraudulent transactions that are surrounded by a large number of legitimate transactions. In this case, global outlier detection would not be able to identify the fraudulent transactions because they would not be significantly different from the legitimate transactions. However, local outlier detection would be able to identify the fraudulent transactions because they would be significantly different from their neighboring transactions.\n",
